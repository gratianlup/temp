???+ note
    The documentation is currently being worked on.  
    Several pages need to be completed or are currently missing (the *Additional functionality* section).

#### Documentation tips

Most app views have a *question mark* button in the upper-right corner.  
*Click* it to view the panel's documentation page in the app's built-in *Help* panel.  

**Images**

Click on an image to enlarge it. Depending on where the documentation is viewed:  

- the image is opened in a new tab if viewed in a browser.
- the image is opened in a preview popup if viewed from the app's built-in *Help* panel.  
To close the preview popup, click again on the image (either in the preview popup or in the page) or press the Escape key.

**Videos**

Click on a video's full-screen button in the bottom-right corner to enlarge it.
