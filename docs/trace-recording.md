#### Recording a trace

ETW traces can be recorded directly from the app in several ways:  

- starting a new process.
- attaching to a running process.
- system-wide (default ETW recording mode).

There are several ways to start a recording:

- Use the **Record** button in the *Start Page* displayed on startup.
- Use the **Profiling** -> **Record Profile** menu.
