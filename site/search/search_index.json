In this view, function instances are nodes with a size proportional to the time spent relative to the caller (parent) function and makes it easier to identify the portions of the app that take most of the time.  </p> <p>Nodes are sorted in the horizontal direction based on decreasing time relative to their parent node, while the ordering in the vertical direction forms a stack trace (a path in the call tree). The function taking the most time in the application is then found in the leftmost, bottom part of the Flame graph.</p> <p> In the example above, the main function is considered the process entry point, calling foo and bar, with foo taking 60% of the time and bar 40%. Function foo spends a part of its total (inclusive) time in the calls to baz and etc1, while the rest is self (exclusive) time, meaning instructions part of foo which are not calls to other functions.  </p> <p>Note that there are two instances of the function baz with different execution time, each with a unique path to it in the call tree starting from main (all other functions have a single instance). You can see the time of each instance by hovering with the mouse over it or in the Details panel after it's selected.</p> <p>The following links provide an introduction to the flame graph visualization concept, its history, and how it's being used across the industry for performance investigations.  </p> <ul> <li>CPU Flame Graphs (brendangregg.com)</li> <li>Visualizing Performance - The Developers\u2019 Guide to Flame Graphs (youtube.com)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"flame-graph-panel.html#flame-graph-overview","title":"Flame graph overview","text":"<p>The Flame graph view is the main means of identifying the parts of the application where most time is spent.
