Function foo spends a part of its total (inclusive) time in the calls to baz and etc1, while the rest is self (exclusive) time, meaning instructions part of foo which are not calls to other functions.  </p> <p>Note that there are two instances of the function baz with different execution time, each with a unique path to it in the call tree starting from main (all other functions have a single instance).
