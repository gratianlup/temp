In this view, function instances are nodes with a size proportional to the time spent relative to the parent (caller) function and makes it easier to identify the portions of the app that take most of the time.  </p> <p>Nodes are sorted in the horizontal direction based on decreasing time relative to their parent node, while the ordering in the vertical direction forms a stack trace (a path in the call tree).</p> <p> In the example above, the main function is considered the prcoess entry point, calling foo and bar, with foo taking 60% of the time and bar 40%. Function foo spends a part of its total (inclusive) time in the calls to baz and etc1, while the rest is self (exclusive) time, meaning instructions part of foo which are not calls to other functions.  </p> <p>Note that there are two instances of the function baz with different execution time, each with a unique path to it in the call tree starting from main (all other functions have a single instance). You can see the time of each instance by hovering with the mouse over it or in the Details panel after it's selected.</p> <p>The following links provide an introduction to the flame graph visualization concept, its history, and how it's being used across the industry for performance investigations.  </p> <ul> <li>CPU Flame Graphs (brendangregg.com)</li> <li>Visualizing Performance - The Developers\u2019 Guide to Flame Graphs (youtube.com)</li> </ul> <p>The Flame graph view is the main means of identifying the parts of the application where most time is spent.

Click Selects the pointed node and deselects any previously selected node. The Details panel is updated and, if Sync is enabled, the function is selected in the other panels.Clicking an empty part of the view deselects all nodes. Ctrl+Click Selects the pointed node and keeps the previously selected nodes (append). The Details panel is updated to display a combined view of all selected nodes. Shift+Click When a node is already selected, it expands the selection to include all nodes in the call stack found between the pointed node and selected one. The Details panel is updated to display a combined view of all selected nodes. Double-click Enlarges (zooms-in) the pointed node to cover the view's width, adjusting child node widths accoringly.

An alternative is pressing the Backspace key or the Back button in the toolbar. Right-click Shows the context menu for the selected nodes. Available actions are documented below.
